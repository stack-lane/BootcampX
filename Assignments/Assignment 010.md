## Specifications

Create your portfolio website using React.js + ReactRouter.

Your portfolio website should compulsorily include the following sections --

1. Profile
2. About
3. Work Experience
4. Projects
5. Interests
6. Education
7. Contact
8. Footer

Once your website is ready, host it on [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

## Import Points

- Ensure good semantic structuring of your HTML.
- Ensure good UI/UX. Crappy websites will not be entertained.
- Ensure good coding practices.
- Consider using [Zustand](https://zustand-demo.pmnd.rs) (rather than `useState`) if you'd require state management.
