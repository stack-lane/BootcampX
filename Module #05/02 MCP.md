# Model Context Protocol

- The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard developed by Anthropic to facilitate seamless integration between AI assistants (like large language models) and external data sources, tools, and systems.
- It addresses the challenge of providing AI models with real-time, relevant, and structured information while maintaining security, privacy, and modularity.
- Think of MCP as a standardized bridge that allows AI models to access and interact with various data sources and tools in a consistent and secure manner.

## Core Components Of MCP

1. **MCP Client**

- The AI assistant or application that requests data or actions.

2. **MCP Server**

- Exposes data sources or tools to the client. It handles authentication, data retrieval, and formatting.

3. **Resources**

- Data entities that can be fetched or manipulated (e.g., files, database entries).

4. **Tools**

- Functions or actions that can be executed (e.g., sending an email, querying a database).

5. **Prompts**

- Predefined instructions or templates to guide AI behavior.

6. **Transports**

- Communication channels between clients and servers, such as HTTP or standard I/O streams.

## Setting Up MCP with TypeScript and Node.js

1. Install the MCP TypeScript SDK

   ```bash
   npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
   ```

2. Create an MCP Server

   Here's a basic example of setting up an MCP server that exposes a simple "Hello World" tool:

   ```TypeScript
   import { createServer } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk';

   const server = createServer({
     tools: [
       {
         name: 'helloWorld',
         description: 'Returns a greeting message.',
         parameters: {
           type: 'object',
           properties: {
             name: { type: 'string' },
           },
           required: ['name'],
         },
         handler: async ({ name }) => {
           return `Hello, ${name}!`;
         },
       },
     ],
   });

   server.listen(3000, () => {
     console.log('MCP server is running on port 3000');
   });
   ```

3. Connect an MCP Client

   The client (e.g., an AI assistant) can now connect to this server and invoke the helloWorld tool by sending a request with the appropriate parameters.

## Security Considerations

While MCP provides a standardized way to connect AI models with external tools and data sources, it's crucial to implement proper security measures:

- **Authentication**: Ensure that only authorized clients can access the MCP server.
- **Input Validation**: Validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Keep logs of all interactions for auditing purposes.
